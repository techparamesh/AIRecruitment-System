# hushHush-PerfectPatterns
To build the hushHush recruiter for Doodle, we will need to design a system that automates the candidate selection process based on various data points while ensuring data privacy and notifying the candidates about the results.

## Prerequisites

- Install Python 3.10.6 or above  
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Clone this repository to your local machine using either Github Desktop or (`git clone repository_url`) on cmd
  
## Usage
1. Configure the data collection scripts to retrieve the desired data points from each data source.
2. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and the terms of service of each data source.
3. Customize and extend the data collection scripts as needed to enhance the quality of collected data.

# Stackoverflow Candidate Data Scraper

This Python script is designed to fetch candidate data from Stackoverflow using the Stack Exchange API. It leverages multithreading for efficient data retrieval, caches requests to avoid overloading the API, and stores the data in a **MongoDB collection**.

# Machine Learning Algorithims 
This project involves the selection of candidates from Stackoverflow data using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, clustering, and logistic regression modeling.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pymongo (for MongoDB operations)
